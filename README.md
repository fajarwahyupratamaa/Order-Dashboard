# Order-Dashboard
This Ordering Dashboard project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard to analyze and visualize order data in the company. The dashboard displays various important metrics such as the total number of orders, number of customers, number of states served, number of market segments, and total profit earned. In addition, the dashboard contains visualizations of order distribution by region, product category, and market segment, which helps identify order patterns and best performing areas.

Interactive features such as filters for region, market segment, product category, and delivery mode allow users to customize the data view as per their analysis needs. Information on the number of orders in key cities such as New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle is also included to provide further insight into regional performance. Order trends are displayed in annual and monthly charts, which helps in identifying seasonal fluctuations and long-term trends.

Order details that include order date, order ID, quantity, and region help in in-depth analysis of each transaction. In addition, order quantity data by major customer provides an overview of the customer's contribution to overall sales. The dashboard is designed to provide in-depth and easy-to-understand insights, helping companies in making better strategic decisions related to sales and operations.
